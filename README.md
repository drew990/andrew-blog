## Description

Andrew's Tech Blog is where you can share post about anything tech related or other off topics if you feel like it. What this system uses to store data is `MySQL`. Because of it, other people can create blogs and comments on other blogs if they want to debate or other things. Feel free to try it out yourself! ðŸ˜€
